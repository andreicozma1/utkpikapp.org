        <h1>How it all began...</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In 1927, a couple of friends came together at the University of Tennessee to create the fraternity Chi Sigma
            Delta. A local fraternity, Chi Sigma Delta, aspired to become "more," so they contacted the National
            fraternity of Pi Kappa Phi. With that, the Alpha Sigma Chapter was born on January 4, 1931. In the early
            history of the
            chapter, Howard Baker, a former white house chief of staff was pledged by Sam Browder. In the 40's Pi Kappa
            Phi received its name "PONG" after the the girls noticed Pi Kappa Phi would play ping pong all through the
            night. Howard Baker Jr. was quoted in the newspaper as saying, "The guys play all the time, the other night I
            came back from celebrating after being elected SGA President, as I walked in everyone cheered and celebrated
            with me, but the game never stopped." </p>

          <p>
            Alpha Sigma moved to multiple houses including one on Lake Avenue, Cumberland Avenue, Temple Avenue and Laurel
            Avenue. In the 1960's, the chapter purchased the house at 1828 Fraternity Park Drive from Zeta Beta Tau, and
            has occupied the house since then. The house was operated by the Alpha Sigma Housing Corporation until the
            house was transferred to Pi Kappa Phi Properties in 2017. It was updated in 2010 with $600,000 in renovations.

          <img src="/res/header.png">
        <p>
          Other notable alumni include Mike Mynatt, former President of the Housing Corporation, who received the
          Chapter Advisor of the Year Award, and was one of the longest running Chapter Advisors in Alpha Sigma history.
          Another alumni, William Sigmon, has served on the Board of Directors for Ability Experience, on the National
          Council, and is now Vice President of the National Council. Earl Zwingle, one of the earliest Alpha Sigma
          initiates, was known as UT's most loyal alumni, and was heavily involved in the creation of the Torch Bearer
          at UT.

          <p>
            In light of members being unable to abide by the fraternities standards of conduct, in 2013, the University of
            Tennessee took steps to revoke Pi Kappa Phi's registration. This was following the revocation of their charter
            by Nationals. Alpha Sigma started its recolonization when Tim Welles called Nationals in Spring of 2017. He
            started pulling together a group of eight guys consisting of Alex Tate, Jake Ragland, Carter Cooley, Chad
            Goral, Sami Ahmed and Andrew Ten Eyck. After the beginning of Fall 2017, Nationals sent two leadership
            consultants, Chris Huffman and Conner Burk, to help recruit men off the no-bids list and around campus. After
            recruitment, elections were held at which time Tim Welles was elected as Archon. All meetings were held in the
            Humanities and Social Sciences building on campus. Spring recruitment was held outside on Fiji Island in the
            freezing cold, but our men persevered and managed to recruit some new members. Shortly thereafter, brother Ovi
            Kabir was selected as the President Elect of the Student Government Association at the University of
            Tennessee. Alpha Sigma has a long history of being involved in All Campus Events, Interfraternity Council and
            Order of Omega. Alpha Sigma has always been well-known for being one of the top contributors for Journey of
            Hope. We were fortunate enough to have a brother, Ben Ross, ride JoH North over the summer. </p>
