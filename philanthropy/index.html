        <div>


          <p>Ability Camps are national service projects that provide funding and manpower to build and renovate
            structures for camps and facilities serving the disability community. Members of Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity
            from various universities construct accessible fishing piers, boardwalks, pavilions, playgrounds and more in
            an effort to highlight the abilities of people with disabilities. The work done will help enhance the lives
            of people with disabilities while also building bonds of brotherhood.</p>

        <h1>Journey of Hope</h1>
        <div>


          <p>In 1987, one manâ€™s dream of riding his bike across the country came true. What he did not know was the
            inspiration and motivation his trek across America would give to The Ability Experience. The very next year,
            his ride inspired The Ability Experience to create the largest fraternal fundraising and awareness event of
            its kind, the Journey of Hope. Today the Journey of Hope covers 32 different states, cycling over 12,000
            miles combined, it is solely comprised of members of Pi Kappa Phi and continues to spread a message of
            acceptance and understanding for people with disabilities.</p>

        <h1>Gear Up Florida</h1>
        <div>

          <p>Since 1997, over 500 Pi Kappa Phi men have participated in Gear Up Florida. Each year, the team raises over
            $80,000 to benefit people with disabilities. Gear Up Florida was created with one mission in mind: to reach
            out to as many people as possible across the state of Florida, spreading a message of acceptance and
            understanding on behalf of people with disabilities. Gear Up Florida has served that mission well by
            creating an event that is touted as "The best two weeks of programming The Ability Experience has to offer."

          <p>Started in 2003, Build America is a four-week team event traveling the country promoting accessible

            anyone!</p>
