            <p>Ability Camps are national service projects that provide funding and manpower to build and renovate
              structures for camps and facilities serving the disability community. Members of Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity
              from various universities construct accessible fishing piers, boardwalks, pavilions, playgrounds and more
              in
              an effort to highlight the abilities of people with disabilities. The work done will help enhance the
              lives
              of people with disabilities while also building bonds of brotherhood.</p>

            <h1>Journey of Hope</h1>
            <p>In 1987, one manâ€™s dream of riding his bike across the country came true. What he did not know was the
              inspiration and motivation his trek across America would give to The Ability Experience. The very next
              year,
              his ride inspired The Ability Experience to create the largest fraternal fundraising and awareness event
              of
              its kind, the Journey of Hope. Today the Journey of Hope covers 32 different states, cycling over 12,000
              miles combined, it is solely comprised of members of Pi Kappa Phi and continues to spread a message of
              acceptance and understanding for people with disabilities.</p>

            <h1>Gear Up Florida</h1>
            <p>Since 1997, over 500 Pi Kappa Phi men have participated in Gear Up Florida. Each year, the team raises
              over
              $80,000 to benefit people with disabilities. Gear Up Florida was created with one mission in mind: to
              reach
              out to as many people as possible across the state of Florida, spreading a message of acceptance and
              understanding on behalf of people with disabilities. Gear Up Florida has served that mission well by
              creating an event that is touted as "The best two weeks of programming The Ability Experience has to
              offer."
